    "# Window Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are working with aggregate values it is necessary that use GROUP BY with **all** non-aggregate columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions are a class of functions that perform calculations on a result set that has already been generated, also referred to as a \"window\".\n",
    "- You can use window functions to perform aggregate calculations without having to group your data, just as you did with a subquery in SELECT\n",
    "- You can also use them to calculate information such as running totals, rankings, and moving averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences\n",
    "- window functions are processed after the entire query except the final ORDER BY statement. \n",
    "- the window function uses the result set to calculate information, as opposed to using the database directly. \n",
    "- window functions are available in PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, but not in SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tem simplest application for window functions is numbering rows.\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  *,\n",
    "  -- Assign numbers to each row\n",
    "  ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS Row_N\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "ORDER BY Row_N ASC;\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you can calculate the AVG of home_goal and away_goal, and follow it with the *OVER* clause. This clause tells SQL to *\"pass this aggregate value over this existing result set.\"*\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "SELECT date,    (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,\n",
    "       AVG(home_goal + away_goal) OVER() AS overall_avg\n",
    "FROM match\n",
    "WHERE season = '2011/2012';\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "The OVER clause indicates that a function is a window function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ORDER BY\n",
    "ORDER BY in OVER orders the rows related to the current row\n",
    "- Example: Ordering by year in descending order in ROW_NUMBER's OVER clause will assign 1 to the most recent year's row\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "SELECT year, event\n",
    "       ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY year DESC, event ASC) AS Row_N\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "ORDER BY year, event;\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "- ORDER inside OVER takes effect before the ORDER outside of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LAG\n",
    "LAG is a window function that takes a column and a number n and returns the column's value n rows before the current row. \n",
    "- Passing 1 as n returns the previous row's value.\n",
    "- LAG(column, n) OVER (...)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Window Partitions\n",
    "PARTITION BY splits the table into partitions based on a column's unique values;\n",
    "\n",
    "A partition allows you to calculate separate values for different categories established in a partition.\n",
    "- calculate different calculations in the same column\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season)\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, to answer how many goals were scored in each match, and how did that compare to season's average?\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "SELECT date,\n",
    "       (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,\n",
    "       AVG(home_goal + away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) as season_avg\n",
    "FROM match;\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "### PARTITION by Multiple Columns\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, name)\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "PARTITION BY is a pretty straight forward addition to the OVER clause.\n",
    "- You can partition calculations by 1 or more columns as necessary to answer a question you may have.\n",
    "- You can use a PARTITION with any kind of window function\n",
    "    - calculation, rank, or others\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Four Functions\n",
    "Relative\n",
    "- LAG(column, n) return column's value at row n rows before the current row\n",
    "- LEAD(column, n) return column's value at row n rows after the current row\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute\n",
    "- FIRST_VALUE(column) returns the first value in the table or partition\n",
    "- LAST_VALUE(column) returns the last value in the table or partition\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, \n",
    "For each year, fetch the current gold medalist and the gold medalist 2 competitions ahead of the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",

    "ORDER BY Year ASC;\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rank Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROW_NUMBER() always assigns unique numbers, even if two rows' value are the same\n",
    "- RANK() assings the same number to rows with identical values, skipping over the next number in such case\n",
    "   - creates a column numbering your data set from highest to lowest, or lowest to highest\n",
    "- DENSE_RANK() also assigns the same number to rows with identical values, but doesn't skip over the next numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "SELECT date,    (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,\n",
    "                RANK() OVER(ORDER BY home_goal + away_goal DESC) AS goals_rank\n",
