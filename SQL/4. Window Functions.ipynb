    "# Window Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are working with aggregate values it is necessary that use GROUP BY with **all** non-aggregate columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions are a class of functions that perform calculations on a result set that has already been generated, also referred to as a \"window\".\n",
    "- You can use window functions to perform aggregate calculations without having to group your data, just as you did with a subquery in SELECT\n",
    "- You can also use them to calculate information such as running totals, rankings, and moving averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you can calculate the AVG of home_goal and away_goal, and follow it with the *OVER* clause. This clause tells SQL to *\"pass this aggregate value over this existing result set.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "SELECT date,    (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,\n",
    "       AVG(home_goal + away_goal) OVER() AS overall_avg\n",
    "FROM match\n",
    "WHERE season = '2011/2012';\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generate a RANK\n",
    "A RANK simply creates a column numbering your data set from highest to lowest, or lowest to highest, based on a column that you specify. \n",
    "What is the rank of matches based on number of goals scored?\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "SELECT date,    (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,\n",
    "                RANK() OVER(ORDER BY home_goal + away_goal DESC) AS goals_rank\n",
    "FROM match\n",
    "WHERE season = '2011/2012';\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences\n",
    "- window functions are processed after the entire query except the final ORDER BY statement. \n",
    "- the window function uses the result set to calculate information, as opposed to using the database directly. \n",
    "- window functions are available in PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, but not in SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "## Window Partitions\n",
    "A partition allows you to calculate separate values for different categories established in a partition.\n",
    "- calculate different calculations in the same column\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season)\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, to answer how many goals were scored in each match, and how did that compare to season's average?\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "SELECT date,\n",
    "       (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals,\n",
    "       AVG(home_goal + away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) as season_avg\n",
    "FROM match;\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "### PARTITION by Multiple Columns\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, name)\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "PARTITION BY is a pretty straight forward addition to the OVER clause.\n",
    "- You can partition calculations by 1 or more columns as necessary to answer a question you may have.\n",
    "- You can use a PARTITION with any kind of window function\n",
    "    - calculation, rank, or others\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Sliding windows\n",
    "Sliding windows are functions that perform calculations relative to the current row of a data set.\n",
    "- to calculate a wide variety of information that aggregates one row at a time down your data set\n",
    "- can also be partitioned by one or more columns, just like a non-sliding window.\n",
    "- contains specific functions within the OVER clause to specify the data you want to use in your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~~sql\n",
    "ROWS BETWEEN <start> AND <finish>\n",
    "~~~~ \n",
    "In the ROWS BETWEEN statement, you can specify a number of keywords as shown here. \n",
    "- PRECEDING and FOLLOWING are used to specify the number of rows before, or after, the current row that you want to include in a calculation.\n",
    "- UNBOUNDED PRECEDING and UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING tell SQL that you want to include every row since the beginning, or the end, of the data set in your calculations.\n",
    "- CURRENT ROW tells SQL that you want to stop your calculation at the current row."
