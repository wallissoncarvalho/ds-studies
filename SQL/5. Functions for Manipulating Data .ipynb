    "### TIMESTAMP data types\n",
    "TIMESTAMPs contain both a date value and a time value with microsecond precision.\n",
    "- These data types are very common because they can be used to record an exact point in time like when a payment was made or a record was last updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DATE and TIME types\n",
    "- DATE and TIME types are essentially the date and time values of the TIMESTAMP. \n",
    "- DATE types contain a date value with no time of day\n",
    "- TIME types contain the time of day but without a date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### INTERVAL data types\n",
    "- INTERVAL types store date and time data as a period of time in years, months, days, hours, seconds, etc.\n",

    "## Arrays\n",
    "To create an ARRAY type, you simply need to add \"square brackets\" to the end of the data type that you want to make an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the following table has an email column which will be a nested array of text data to store the email type and the address for a given student_id. The test_scores column will contain an array of integer values representing the numeric test score.\n",

    "Accessing ARRAYs\n",
    "- Accessing arrays in PostgreSQL is very similar to accessing arrays in other programming languages. For email, you can get the first element of the first array by using the array notation you see here with index values of 1. Note that PostgreSQL array indexes start with one and not zero.\n",
