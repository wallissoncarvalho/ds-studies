    "### Variables\n",
    "There are three types of SQL variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local varibales is a variable that is visible only in the BEGIN – END block in which it was created\n",
    "    - DECLARE is a keyword that can be used when creating local variables only\n",
    "- Session varibale is a variable that exists only for the session in which you are operating\n",
    "    - it is defined on our server, and it lives there\n",
    "    - it is visible to the connection being used only\n",
    "    - To create a MySQL session variable we use SET @variable_name;\n",
    "- Global vairables apply to all connections related to a specific server\n",
    "    - you cannot set just any variable as global\n",
    "    - a specific group of pre-defined variables in MySQL is suitable for this job. They are called system variables\n",
    "    - To create a global variable:\n",

    "## Indexes\n",
    "the index of a table functions like the index of a book\n",
    "- data is taken from a column of the table and is stored in a certain order in a distinct place, called an index\n",
    "- the larger a database is, the slower the process of finding the record or records you need\n",

    "    ON table_name (column_1, column_2, …); -- these must be fields from your data table you will search frequently\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composite Indexes\n",
    "They are applied to multiple columns, not just a single one\n",
    "- carefully pick the columns that would optimize your search!\n",
    "- primary and unique keys are MySQL indexes, they represent columns on which a person would typically base their search"
