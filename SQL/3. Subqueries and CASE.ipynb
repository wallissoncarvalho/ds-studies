    "- you can have a lot moren than one subquery in your outer query\n",
    "- allow for better structuring of the outer query\n",
    "    - thus, each inner query can be thought of in isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the SQL engine starts by running the inner query\n",
    "2. then it uses it returned output, which is intermediate, to execute the outer query\n",
    "3. it is possible to nest inner queries within other inner queries\n",
    "    - in that case, the SQL engine would execute the innermost query first, and then each subsequent query, until it runs the outermost query last\n",
