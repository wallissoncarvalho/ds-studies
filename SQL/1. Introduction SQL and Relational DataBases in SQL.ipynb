    "SQL, which stands for *Structured Query Language*, is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

    "- '<' less than\n",
    "- '>' greater than\n",

    "- '%' is a substitute for a **sequence** of characters\n",
